## 😛 Tic-Tac-Toe

A tic-tac-toe game, built to play when u wanna relax yourself from the daily noise. This is a multiplayer game, so u might need to invite your friends to play haha 😆.

## 2️⃣ Multiplayer 

this mode, you can play with your friend sitting next to you
- The first player get their dedicated emoji which is smiley 😀, and the second player also gets their own emoji which is devil 👿.
- Its up to you which side you wanna play from haha, i would definitely choose 👿 side.
- The player who gets 3 in a row first wins.
- Whether it's a win or a draw, a modal displaying the result appears once the game is over. You'll then see play again buttons:
  - 'Replay' button to play again.

## ⚡ Technologies

- `CSS`
- `HTMl`
- `Javascript`

## 💡 Idea

I just wanted to enhance my javascript skill and I was sitting free so i thought lets play my skill to a test.
I've seen a alot of Tic-Tac-Toe game but they are so plain and broing so i decided to make my implementation better by putting emoji into the game.

This is why I decided to create this project.

## 🤔 How Can It Be Improved?

The project could be improved by adding sound effects and background music. I think it would also be cool to highlight the three rows that the user got to win, to show at the end who won, and i would also like to add single 
player mode into this, so people can play alone, without having any friends. 

## 🐛 Bug
- The game is not for phone, only works on browser.
